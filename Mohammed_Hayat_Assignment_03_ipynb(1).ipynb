It was a little challenging at first to set up the CSV and manage the files, but it was simple once I figured out how to use GitHub uploads. I appreciated having enough time to explore each step thoroughly, although having a little extra flexibility in the deadline would have helped me dive even deeper into the material. Overall, I really loved learning how to generate a labeled dataset—it's a skill I’m convinced will be beneficial in future endeavours."
